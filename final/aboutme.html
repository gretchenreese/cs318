                <p class="aboutme">I was born and raised in Minnesota - but I haven’t lived in Minneapolis, the city I now call home, for my
                    entire life. I’ve spent time abroad whilst in the Navy – I lived in Japan, a vibrant culture that was
                    enticing and inspiring. This was where I had my two sons, and shortly after my second, I moved back to
                    Minneapolis.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutme">I took up pottery as a hobby, a creative outlet that allowed me to put my inspirations into a creative process
                    and create beautiful things. I used to knit, but now pottery has become my frequent hobby. Creating pottery
                    has been an on and off hobby for many years, and I’ve found as I’ve started my creative journey that
                    there are many glazing processes to experiment with, and it’s quite fun to find new favourites.I always
                    liked the idea of selling pieces that I loved, that were beautiful as well as being functional and usable
                    for everyday purposes. Originally, I had only intended to sell them in my studio’s shop – but, I was
                    contacted by my niece in early January of 2018, who needed a client for a project at University. </p>
                <p class="aboutme">The project was building a website, from scratch – thus Varien Handmade was born, and you’re currently looking
                    at the finished product. Before Varien Handmade, I never really ventured into selling the pieces that
                    I’d made. Sure, I’d given some as gifts, but I don’t know whether it was being nervous to start selling
                    my pieces or never truly feeling that they were ‘perfect’ enough to be sold – but this past year, I finally
                    set up some of my pieces in my studio’s shop to be sold. Excited, yes, but a move that made me a bit
                    nervous in terms of not knowing whether people would like my work or not. Now, I’ve branched into wanting
                    to sell my pieces online. This is helping me to really be able to showcase my creativity and find the
                    creative outlet that stimulates my mind and keeps me going. However, we all go through phases of creative
                    block – so whilst some months I’ll be at my wheel 2-3 days a week, some months I may only be there three
                    times total. I hope to be able to have my creations in homes other than mine and my family’s – and that
                    those that purchase them will find them as useful as I do. </p>
