                <p class="content1text">Starting out, when it came to creating pieces in the studio, functionality was the first thing that would
                    come to mind. I wanted to create products that not only I could use, but that others would find useful
                    in their day to day lives.</p>
                <p class="content1text">I took up pottery as a hobby, a creative outlet that allowed me to put my inspirations into a creative process
                        and create beautiful things. I used to knit, but now pottery has become my frequent hobby. Creating pottery
                        has been an on and off hobby for many years, and I’ve found as I’ve started my creative journey that
                        there are many glazing processes to experiment with, and it’s quite fun to find new favourites. I always
                        liked the idea of selling pieces that I loved, that were beautiful as well as being functional and usable
                        for everyday purposes.</p>

                <h1 class="content2head">About Me</h1>
                <p class="content2text">I was born and raised in Minnesota - but I haven’t lived in Minneapolis, the city I now call home, for my
                        entire life. I’ve spent time abroad whilst in the Navy – I lived in Japan, a vibrant culture that was
                        enticing and inspiring. This was where I had my two sons, and shortly after my second, I moved back to
                        Minneapolis.</p>
                <p class="content2text">Before Varien Handmade, I never really ventured into selling the pieces that
                        I’d made. Sure, I’d given some as gifts, but I don’t know whether it was being nervous to start selling
                        my pieces or never truly feeling that they were ‘perfect’ enough to be sold – but this past year, I finally
                        set up some of my pieces in my studio’s shop to be sold. Excited, yes, but a move that made me a bit
                        nervous in terms of not knowing whether people would like my work or not. Now, I’ve branched into wanting
                        to sell my pieces online.</p>
