        <div class="name">Bidoof</div>
        <p>Bidoof is seen as a kind, helpful Pokémon, that is loyal, and will believe his friends, as observed when he was the first to declare that he believed the player's partner's story about Dusknoir. His lacking experience at exploring and status as one of the most junior members of the guild is a recurring element in his character portrayal, and gets him into trouble multiple times, such as when he reveals the guild members during the player's graduation exam.</p>

        <div class="name">Pikachu</div>
        <p>Pikachu encountered Mew one day while playing with his friends Piplup, Charmander, and Chikorita. Mew led them to a mysterious hole which transported them all to the PokéPark. The fall knocked Pikachu unconscious, and he had a dream about Mew. Mew explained that the PokéPark was in danger, that the Sky Prism had shattered and only one that knew true friendship could restore it. If he failed, the Sky Pavilion would crash into the PokéPark.</p>

        <img alt="pokemon archen" src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/b/b2/566Archen_PSMD.png/220px-566Archen_PSMD.png">
        <div class="name">Archen</div>
        <p>Archen is first seen running past the player and partner as they chase after Swirlix after she ate all their food. He later accompanies them on an expedition where they discover the stone bodies of Latios and Latias.</p>

        <div class="name">MewTwo</div>
        <p>Mewtwo has an unusual combination of attributes. Unlike other characters, its throws are exceedingly powerful, capable of KO'ing at similar percentages as smash attacks. It also boasts several fast attacks that can be linked together for simple and effective combos, and possesses an exceptional recovery.</p>

        <div class="name">Xerneas</div>
        <p>After the player and their partner defeat Dark Matter, the Tree of Life comes back to earth. A light descends from the Tree of Life and Xerneas appears, informing the others that it is the Tree of Life.</p>

        <div class="name">Wigglytuff</div>
        <p>Even as an Igglybuff of young age, Wigglytuff was considered a prodigy in exploring by an Armaldo that he discovered and befriended. Seeing him as a mentor and friend, Igglybuff called him "master" repeatedly, even when Armaldo told him to stop.</p>
