    <p><i><h3>Ireland - 13 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Ireland truly is the land of rolling green hills. A truly spectacular view indeed if one ventures to the northern coastline to see the <i>Giant's Causeway</i> or the <i>carrick-a-rede rope bridge</i>. I've not yet seen bluer waters or a more serene landscape. Moving down the cast, one of the most beautiful sights are <i>The Cliffs of Moher</i>, the cliffs where Ireland herself meets the sea. On a cloudy day, you're not guaranteed to see the cliffs, as the fog may even hide them. However, if you're there on a hazy or sunny day, they are indeed breathtaking. Once chilled to the bone after hiking the clifs, a stop at Fitzpatrick's pub is definitely in the cards.</p>
