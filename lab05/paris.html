    <p><i><h3>Paris - 12 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Paris is a beautiful city - true to the name, <i>The City of Love</i>, one is offered roses nearly everywhere you go. Best not accept them, as they'll cost you a pretty penny. The city itself was hazy and grey, very calm atop the Monte Martre area with the Sacre Coeur standing like a gaurdian above the city. The food is never second-best, and the fresh peaches from the produce markets were to die for. Versailles was a stop that is highly reccomended to anyone visiting Paris interested in history. The palace was garnished with golden ornaments, and the <i>Hall of Mirrors</i> was a specatular sight to behold.</p>
