    <p><i><h3>Edinburgh - 14 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Edinburgh, a city well worth the history and the ghost tours. Being situated on a hill, Edinburgh has a castle almost smack in the middle of the city. From there, you can see the city itself, but also the coast of Ireland in the distance. The <i>Royal Mile</i> is a place well worth visiting, as it's got some of the best stops to eat in the city. Mimi's Bakehouse is a personal favourite. The ghost tours have to do with the city plagued by the Bubonic Plague - people were locked in the gated areas of the city (closes) and they are said to be haunted still until this very day. </p>
