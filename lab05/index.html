    <p><i><h3><a href="paris.html">Paris</a> - 12 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Paris is a beautiful city - true to the name, <i>The City of Love</i>, one is offered roses nearly everywhere you go. Best not accept them, as they'll cost you a pretty penny. The city itself was hazy and grey, very calm atop the Monte Martre area with the Sacre Coeur standing like a gaurdian above the city. The food is never second-best, and the fresh peaches from the produce markets were to die for. Versailles was a stop that is highly reccomended to anyone visiting Paris interested in history. The palace was garnished with golden ornaments, and the <i>Hall of Mirrors</i> was a specatular sight to behold.</p>

    <p><h3><i><a href="ireland.html">Ireland</a> - 13 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Ireland truly is the land of rolling green hills. A truly spectacular view indeed if one ventures to the northern coastline to see the <i>Giant's Causeway</i> or the <i>carrick-a-rede rope bridge</i>. I've not yet seen bluer waters or a more serene landscape. Moving down the cast, one of the most beautiful sights are <i>The Cliffs of Moher</i>, the cliffs where Ireland herself meets the sea. On a cloudy day, you're not guaranteed to see the cliffs, as the fog may even hide them. However, if you're there on a hazy or sunny day, they are indeed breathtaking. Once chilled to the bone after hiking the clifs, a stop at Fitzpatrick's pub is definitely in the cards.</p>

    <p><i><h3><a href="edinburgh.html">Edinburgh</a> - 14 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Edinburgh, a city well worth the history and the ghost tours. Being situated on a hill, Edinburgh has a castle almost smack in the middle of the city. From there, you can see the city itself, but also the coast of Ireland in the distance. The <i>Royal Mile</i> is a place well worth visiting, as it's got some of the best stops to eat in the city. Mimi's Bakehouse is a personal favourite. The ghost tours have to do with the city plagued by the Bubonic Plague - people were locked in the gated areas of the city (closes) and they are said to be haunted still until this very day. </p>

    <p><i><h3><a href="grantham.html">Grantham</a> - 15 April 2017</i></h3></p>
    <p>Grantham is a place very special to my heart. I have a second family here, and many memories locked away in a Manor House on the outskirts of the village countryside. The manor itself is located on roughly 250 acres of land, and is a house that has housed many in its many years. From WWI pilots to people like Gregory Gregory or Margaret Van Der Elst, this place is truly a museum that you can live in. If visiting though, the house is only open 6hrs per year to the general public, making it truly a secret nestled away in the hillside that even people living in Grantham their entire lives have never seen the inside of. </p>
