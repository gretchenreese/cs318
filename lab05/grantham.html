    <h3>Grantham - 15 April 2017</h3>
    <p>Grantham is a place very special to my heart. I have a second family here, and many memories locked away in a Manor House on the outskirts of the village countryside. The manor itself is located on roughly 250 acres of land, and is a house that has housed many in its many years. From WWI pilots to people like Gregory Gregory or Margaret Van Der Elst, this place is truly a museum that you can live in. If visiting though, the house is only open 6hrs per year to the general public, making it truly a secret nestled away in the hillside that even people living in Grantham their entire lives have never seen the inside of. </p>
